# TPA Plugin
This is an endstone plugin written with the help of AI (Codex) to achieve simple /tpa commands in game

Requirements:
EndstoneMC API
Python
I dunno what else

You need to rebuild the wheel file of this code to get the tpa plugin .whl then install it on your server via pip install

I only work with AI and really have no prior coding experience. I have just tested this, if I get an error, throw it to chatgpt and let him debug. Send his finding to Codex to rewrite the code. 

Functions

1. /tpa <player-name> = Sends a Teleport Request
2. /tpaccept = Accepts a teleport request from a player
3. /tpdeny = Deny a request from player
